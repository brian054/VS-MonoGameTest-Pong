/*
 * abstract class: a base class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It's meant to be inherited by other classes.
 * 
 * An abstract function cannot have functionality. You're basically saying, any child class MUST give their own 
 * version of this method, however it's too general to even try to implement in the parent class.
 * 
 * abstract functions are also required to be implemented in subclasses.
 * 
 * A virtual function, is basically saying look, here's the functionality that may or may not be good enough for 
 * the child class (so it's optional). Can also be empty. So if it is good enough, use this method, if not, then override 
 * me, and provide your own functionality.
