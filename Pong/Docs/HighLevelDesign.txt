PlayerPaddle class
-------------------------------
Rectangle 
- x, y, width, height

UpdatePaddle()
DrawPaddle()

EnemyPaddle class
--------------------------------
I would extract to a Paddle class but avoid overengineering for this small game

Game class will handle setting all the stuff up, calling the update/draw methods from each class, etc.


Game States:
0 = Menu State
- three buttons, those screens be local to the Menu system, abstract
1 = Playing State
- includes a Paused state, with some buttons
